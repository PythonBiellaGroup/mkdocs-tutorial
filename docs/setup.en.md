## Installation

You can install MkDocs like any other Python library, but it is advisable to use a dependency manager such as PDM or Poetry.

```shell
poetry add mkdocs
```
In addition to the basic installation of MkDocs, you can use various templates that enhance the configuration and initial layout of MkDocs. The library we prefer and recommend is MkDocs Material, which is among the most widely used and appreciated. We will explore some of the features it provides in this tutorial.

```shell
poetry add mkdocs-material
```

With MkDocs, you have the option to enhance functionality with numerous interesting and highly useful extensions, providing a better user experience.
